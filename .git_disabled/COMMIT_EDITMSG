fix(frontend): Correct AWS configuration structure for Cognito and API integration

- Fix aws-config.ts to use window.AWS_CONFIG pattern matching TypeScript interface
- Update App.tsx Amplify.configure() to use correct Cognito structure
- Fix api.ts to read endpoint from awsConfig.API.REST.DRSOrchestration.endpoint
- Update Lambda build script with configuration fixes
- Regenerate frontend-builder.zip with updated build script

This fixes the configuration structure mismatch that prevented the frontend from
loading correctly. The TypeScript interface expected API.REST.DRSOrchestration.endpoint
but the runtime config was only providing API.REST.endpoint.

Resolves frontend configuration loading issues and enables successful authentication.
