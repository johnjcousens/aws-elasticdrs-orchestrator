Wave Names Final Fix Summary - CamelCase Migration Complete
===========================================================

ISSUE RESOLVED: Wave names showing as blank in frontend

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
- Frontend Wave interface was using 'name' and 'description' fields
- API/Database was returning 'waveName' and 'waveDescription' fields (camelCase)
- Field name mismatch caused frontend to display empty values

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED (Following CamelCase Migration Rules):
✅ Updated frontend to match database field names (KEEP IT SIMPLE rule)
✅ Frontend Wave interface now uses: waveName, waveDescription
✅ All frontend components updated to use camelCase field names
✅ No transform functions - direct field mapping throughout stack

CHANGES MADE:
✅ frontend/src/types/index.ts:
   - Wave interface: name → waveName, description → waveDescription

✅ frontend/src/components/RecoveryPlanDialog.tsx:
   - Updated both create and update wave mapping
   - Fixed wave validation error display
   - All references to wave.name → wave.waveName

✅ frontend/src/components/WaveConfigEditor.tsx:
   - Wave display: wave.name → wave.waveName
   - Form fields: name/description → waveName/waveDescription
   - Wave creation: name → waveName
   - Dependency labels: safeWaves[x].name → safeWaves[x].waveName

DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED:
✅ Frontend built successfully with TypeScript validation
✅ Deployed to CloudFront: https://***REMOVED***.cloudfront.net
✅ CloudFront cache invalidated (IEXSHFN9ZO451M4MOZMUMXSQ3R)

VERIFICATION:
✅ API returns correct wave data:
   - "waveName": "TEST"
   - "waveName": "DatabaseTier" 
   - "waveName": "ApplicationTier"

✅ Database contains camelCase fields:
   - waveName, waveDescription (consistent throughout)

✅ Frontend now expects camelCase fields:
   - waveName, waveDescription (matches database/API)

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Wave names fix COMPLETE
✅ CamelCase migration rules followed correctly
✅ Same field names used throughout entire stack
✅ No transform functions - direct field mapping
✅ Frontend deployed and ready for testing

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test frontend UI - wave names should now display correctly
2. Test recovery plan creation/editing with wave names
3. Verify end-to-end functionality works properly

TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
- Database: waveName, waveDescription (camelCase)
- API: waveName, waveDescription (raw database fields)
- Frontend: waveName, waveDescription (same as database)
- Transform Functions: 0 (eliminated for performance)
- Field Mapping: Direct (no transformation layer)

This follows the camelCase migration rules perfectly:
"Everything uses the SAME camelCase field names throughout the entire stack"
