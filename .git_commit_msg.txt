feat: Tag-based Protection Groups and enhanced orchestration state

Tag-Based Protection Groups:
- Support tag-based server selection using EC2 instance tags
- Tags resolved against EC2 instances (not DRS resource tags)
- Mutually exclusive: tag-based OR explicit server selection
- Tag conflict prevention with TAG_CONFLICT error code
- Servers matching other PG tags grayed out in UI

Enhanced Orchestration State Object:
- Added plan_name, total_waves, completed_waves, failed_waves
- Added status_reason, error_code for failure handling
- Added recovery_instance_ids, recovery_instance_ips for downstream tasks
- Added start_time, end_time, duration_seconds for SLA tracking
- Enables parent Step Functions to chain automation after DR execution

UI Improvements:
- Expanded Recovery Plan ID column to show full UUID
- Copy button positioned right of Plan ID without word wrap
- Fixed duplicate import issue in InvocationSourceBadge.tsx

Updated CHANGELOG.md and README.md with new features
