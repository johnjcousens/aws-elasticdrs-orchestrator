Retrospective
-------------

Add your Start doing, Stop doing, and Keep doing items to the table below. We'll use these to talk about how we can improve our process going forward.

| **Worked Well** | **Didn’t Work** | **Kinda Worked** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Things that worked really well | Things that did not work | Things that kind of worked but may need some tweaking |
| Tech Lead Syncs | Finding workstream intersection points |  |
| Really good idea to get inventory of various BUs.  Helped with internal cmdb effort. | Heard from the team a majority of assumptions are made based on HRP. Each BU could get individual focus | Meeting timing – Foundation too long |
| Collaboration with HE teams | Trying to find “one” source of truth for inventory (reducing time to freeze scope) | Standup meeting time for this group. Possibly reduce to 15 mins? |
| The HealthEdge team is incredibly responsive and committed to this effort | Foundations team structure from HE – To include GC, Source, PDM, MRF representatives (For better design of LZA mainly network and other requirements) | Revisit attendee list for meeting cadences |
| Great commitment from HE teams on inventory |  | Stand ups are a little long for a scrum. |
| Quick responses from HE teams (ModelizeIT agent install etc) |  | Sprint capacity estimates were inconsistent for some workstreams, leading to rollover of items |
| Architecture Diagram by the respective BU team |  | Scheduling HE meetings times can be a challenge with multiple workstreams. |
|  |  | 3 days standups in a week (Suggestion) - Portfolio & Migrations |

Action items
------------

Add 1-2 follow-up action items to help the team apply what they learned in the retrospective:



- [ ] Reduce meeting invitation times to better reflect actual time commitments (DSUs 15 minutes)
- [x] Validate attendee list for all meetings
- [ ] Validate during Sprint Planning all work fits within the current sprint’s capacity
- [ ] Review meeting cadences during sprint 2 to determine if we need to reduce the number of standups (3x week vs currently 4x)
- [x] Ensure representation is present for all BUs while planning landing zone requirements
