In HealthEdge project, Sprint Demo/Retro meetings are crucial end-of-sprint events. During the Demo, the team showcases completed work to stakeholders and receives feedback. The Retrospective follows, where team members discuss what went well, what didn't, and identify improvements for the next sprint. These meetings typically occur every 2-3 weeks and are essential for maintaining project transparency and continuous improvement.
