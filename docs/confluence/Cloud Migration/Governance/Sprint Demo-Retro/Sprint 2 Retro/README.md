Retrospective
-------------

Add your Start doing, Stop doing, and Keep doing items to the table below. We'll use these to talk about how we can improve our process going forward.

| **Worked Well** | **Didn’t Work** | **Kinda Worked** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Great collaboration with BU teams on Data Discovery | Backlog refinement? Most of the stories are present in backlog? | During the discovery phase we found out that each BUs has their own policies/processes/tools/people setup. We did not have all BU presence due to not knowing who’s the best person to be included in the call. However we did pull people as we learn new names, also with people we interviewed, we do get a good enough representation of how HealthEdge operates in whole picture. And later when we start design phase, we will confirm with all BUs, and try to form all perspective in a unified operation model in AWS |
| Speed of decision making and escalations if needed | Better way to track RAID? How to link with Jira stories? |  |
| Collaboration between security team and AWS has been great and essential for building out the first part of the landing zone | Business decisions to fast-track non-migration deployments/initiatives; creates confusion and risk. |  |
