The goal of this workshop is to introduce disaster recovery workshop options and concepts as they relate to AWS. This workshop helps customers understand the disaster recovery options available to them and the high level tradeoffs between approaches. The operations workstream is focused on validating operational readiness for disaster recovery by confirming that a backup and recovery standard is in place to implement basic disaster recovery capability. More advanced disaster recovery options require individual assessment per application to define, implement, test, and deploy the required DR architecture.
