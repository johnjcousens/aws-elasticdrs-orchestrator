Availability and Continuity Management Design
=============================================

Availability and Continuity Management identifies repeatable patterns to support business continuity needs based upon customer needs.

| **AWS Recommended Cloud Approach** |
| --- |
| **Availability Architecture** Amazon Web Services provides services and infrastructure to build reliable, fault-tolerant, and highly available systems in the cloud.    AWS defines fault-tolerance as the ability for a system to remain operational despite a failure of one or more components. Highly-available architectures take this further, by ensuring that performance is not impacted as a result of one or more component failures.    Services that provide basic infrastructures, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), provide specific features, such as availability zones, elastic IP addresses, and snapshots, that a fault-tolerant and a highly available system must take advantage of and use correctly.    The higher-level AWS services, such as Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SQS, and Elastic Load Balancing, are built with both fault tolerance and high availability in mind. These services are regional, providing services across multiple availability zones for the regions to which they are launched.    Through the evaluation of each business application, customers can select the appropriate level of availability based upon the options below. It follows Well-Architected best practices to deploy your workloads to multiple locations by distributing load across multiple Availability Zones and AWS regions (for example, DNS, ELB, Application Load Balancer, and Amazon API Gateway). These locations can be as diverse as needed.  Options:   * Maintain current level of application availability. For example, if an on-premise application is in one data center today then provision in one AWS Availability Zone so long as SLA's meet requirement.       + If selecting this option, policy adherence to snapshots and CloudFormation templates should be utilized to ensure reliable availability. * Improve the existing level of application availability by taking advantage of two (2) AWS Availability Zones incorporating Amazon Elastic Load Balancers with traditional databases configured for active/passive synchronous replication. * When using databases that natively offer active/active/active synchronous replication or you intend to consume heavy Amazon EC2 Spot Instances consider using three (3) or more AWS Availability Zones. * For applications requiring high availability globally, consider maintaining duplicate software and infrastructure in multiple AWS Regions and route traffic using Amazon Route 53.     Details about the AWS Global Network, Edge Locations, Regions, AZs, custom Hardware, and Benefits can be found at: <https://infrastructure.aws/>  **Availability Zones**  Highly available architectures must avoid single points of failure. In Amazon terms, this means they should at a minimum span multiple availability zones.  For Amazon RDS, it is strongly recommended to use Multi-AZ deployments. Replica database systems are excellent for scaling out read capacity but do not provide automated resilience to AZ or instance degradation.    **Regions**  AWS services are available in multiple regions around the globe so that you can choose the most appropriate location for your production and DR sites. Regional diversity is not strictly required to maintain a highly-available architecture. However, it is best to consider and design for multi-region from the outset. Considerations include any database replication constraints, replicating other persistent data for low-latency access from alternate regions (such as Amazon S3 bucket replication), and ensuring components (such as AMIs) are available in other regions.    Choose alternate region(s), wisely. Some AWS services are available in only a subset of AWS regions. So, be sure to choose an alternate region(s) that offer all of the critical services required by your applications. Consult the [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) to help make the best choice.      **Data replication**  Maintaining true fault tolerance and high availability implies systems are not dependent upon backup and recovery mechanisms. Live data must be made available to all systems within the application/environment/region despite a single system or component failure. To this end, here are some guidelines for data replication to accomplish a highly available architecture:   * Only use instance store storage for ephemeral purposes: cache, temp files, other transient data * Avoid using Amazon EBS storage for regional storage unless the application manages redundancy.       + This may be unavoidable for some applications that require block level, filesystem storage.   + In these cases, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) (currently only supported by Linux) may be beneficial.   + Otherwise, Amazon EBS snapshots or remounting of Amazon EBS volumes can help prevent data loss. * Configure Amazon S3 Bucket replication to ensure critical application data is available in an alternate region.       + Amazon S3 is designed with 11-9's of durability and 99.9% availability, but your applications running in EC2 likely is not architected to this level. While systems running in an alternate region can access S3 buckets in the primary, the latency may be unacceptable.   + Also, remember that any data in a bucket before configuring replication is not automatically replicated. * Use Multi-AZ RDS or another asynchronous database replication if possible   **Multi-Region Deployments**  Deploying applications in multiple regions can be accomplished with several different postures depending on cost, availability and RPO/RTO requirements. To ensure consistency across regions, practicing Infrastructure as Code via CloudFormation or other tools are essential for effective multi-region deployments. Three of the deployment postures are:   * **Pilot light** – Live, real-time data is replicated and available in an alternate region, but no other application services are up or incurring significant cost. * **Warm Standby** – Live data available in an alternate region along with scaled down application stack ready to be auto-scaled based on consumption metrics or preemptive scaling configuration changes. * **Active/Active (Multi-Site)** – Full production scale replica of entire stack and data running in at least one alternate region with the distribution of traffic via global load balancing (DNS) with status check ensuring each region's health. |

| **Operational Readiness State Approach** |
| --- |
| For the Operational Readiness State, the following should be implemented.   * Establish RPO/RTO Objectives     worddava1758e03a474e801cbfdd136f2d01bc0.png * Determine and document both the recovery point and recovery time objectives for each application.     worddav15f9255da52f479cb4c4564908bcf930.png * Ensure all application components span multiple availability zones.   + This includes:      - Subnets     - Load balancers     - Web/front-end tier     - Application servers     - Databases (Multi-AZ deployments with RDS) * Choose an alternate region or regions for a potential multi-region deployment. * Whether you intend to run multi-region or not, it is best to at least identify potential regions based on service availability, latency, cost or other requirements. Review the AWS Region Table to select the best region(s). * Ensure Amazon S3 buckets with critical application data are configured for cross-region replication. * It is not necessary to replicate utility buckets such as those that store operational data (logs). Buckets that contain data that is either not sensitive to latency or impactful to application runtime may also not require replication. |

| **Recommendations for Future Enhancements** |
| --- |
| **Post Operational Readiness State, \[Customer\] should prepare for Pilot light deployments as discussed in the COM workshop by:**   * Ensuring all standard AMIs are copied to alternate region(s) * Integrating AMI copy process into patch management procedures, to ensure all future images are available in all regions * Configuring database replica(s) in alternate region(s) * Consider DNS and/or routing requirements for cutting over to the alternate region if needed   **Determine long-term multi-region deployment strategy per application**   * Widespread AWS outages are rare, but they have happened. * Some applications may have different RPO/RTO and others may not require multi-region. * Assess, document and prepare for multi-region per application * Create an availability matrix by application/region if applicable |

Availability Testing
====================

| **AWS Recommended Cloud Approach** |
| --- |
| **Testing**  Confidence in the resiliency of any architecture is derived from routinely testing it to ensure it is truly highly available. AWS provides services that make this much easier than in traditional data centers, but this testing step must not be neglected. Depending on the requirements and deployment methodology, this testing can be as simple as disassociating all application servers from a load balancer in a single zone to simulating an entire regional outage.     **Simulation environments**  One of the benefits of AWS is that infrastructure can be deployed at a moment's notice and charged only for hours used. This means that with the proper automation, a full replica of your production stacks can be deployed within minutes, and changes can be tested at full scale without touching production resources.    **Game Day Scenarios**  Game Day Scenarios are used to validate the interactions of people, process and tooling are performing as expected. Conducting these regularly to exercise failure procedures with the people who will be involved in actual failure scenarios is a Well-Architected best practice. The goals of Game Day Scenarios are to:   * Demonstrate how prepared is \[Insert Customer Name\] for \[Insert Application/Solution Name\] deployment to Production environment * Determine how \[Insert Customer Name\] can improve application, infrastructure and operational readiness   **Two Game Day scenarios approaches are:**   1. Injecting failure into an application and observing the actions of the solution, processes and support/maintenance people to the scenario; this is a Well-Architected best practice 2. Observing/Validating an identified model or specific process (i.e. COM- Incident/Event Mgmt) is performing as expected   Outcomes from a Game Day scenario are:   * Remediation activities * Process refinement/tuning * Improved application/infrastructure workloads. |

| **Sample Operational Readiness State Approach** |
| --- |
| Intra-region resiliency  For the Operational Readiness State, \[Customer\] will conduct a Game Day Scenario on a selected application migrating to the AWS platform. The resiliency of each application should be tested within a single region. Resiliency testing will involve a failure of each component in a non-production environment and via various failure states. Resiliency testing can be accomplished via:   * **Resource exhaustion** – simulate CPU consumption, memory exhaustion or disk capacity limitations * **Connectivity issues/network timeout** – simulate timeout via security group or NACL change * **Data loss** - simulate EBS failure by force detaching a volume, or an S3 outage via IP Tables change or data deletion, configuration change * **System crash** – remove instance from load balancer or simply terminate the instance * **Sudden volume spike** – using a load generation tool to ensure auto-scaling is effective |

| **Recommendations for Future Enhancements** |
| --- |
| **Multi-region resiliency** According to your RPO/RTO requirements, perform the above Intra-region tests for all applications across multiple systems to trigger a regional failover event. **Simulation environment** Using AWS CloudFormation, deploy an identical stack to production in an alternate region, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) or account. This new environment can be long-lived for extended saturation tests or exist for only hours for short tests. Regardless, testing major application or architectural changes at production-level peak volumes are essential to providing confidence in these major changes. |

Backup and Recovery
===================

| **AWS Recommended Cloud Approach** |
| --- |
| Most organizations initially maintain their existing backup and recovery processes and software to avoid friction in cloud adoption. However, as your adoption extends and matures, organizations select a blend of backup and recovery options from the list outlined below:  Options:   * Maintain current backup and recovery process and software for Amazon EC2 instances * A hybrid backup and restore process using the same agent-based software for EC2 and Amazon RDS snapshots * Implement the use of EBS snapshots combined with a snapshot retention policy   **S3**  As discussed in the Availability section, S3 is designed for 11-9's of durability. This durability translates to a high degree of confidence that all data written to S3 is secured. Strictly speaking, it is not necessary to configure cross-region bucket replication or perform any subsequent backups of data stored in S3. However, this level of durability does not prevent against accidental or malicious deletion or tampering. In these cases, or for any other data that is deemed extremely critical, enabling versioning, MFA Delete and cross-region bucket replication are recommended.    Lifecycle policies can also be enabled for S3 data, which will transition the data to lower-cost models with the same durability, but decreased availability. These include S3 Infrequent Access (99.0% availability SLA and accessible via the same S3 API) or Glacier (slower archival storage with restore times in minutes or hours, at significantly reduced cost).  **EBS**  EBS snapshots are incremental backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. These incremental backups minimize the time required to create the snapshot and save on storage costs by not duplicating data. When you delete a snapshot, only the data unique to that snapshot is removed. Each snapshot contains all of the information needed to restore your data  When you delete a snapshot, only the data referenced exclusively by that snapshot is removed. Even though snapshots are saved incrementally, the snapshot deletion process is designed so that you need to retain only the most recent snapshot to restore the volume. Deleting previous snapshots of a volume does not affect your ability to restore volumes from later snapshots of that volume.  Deleting a snapshot might not reduce your data storage costs. Other snapshots might reference that snapshot's data, and referenced data is always preserved.  **Databases**  Database backups should be performed periodically. Database replicas and multi-AZ RDS deployments are not sufficient to ensure recoverability from data loss or corruption. The backup schedule should coincide with the RPO/RTO per application. RDS also features ["point-in-time" database recovery](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html) by replaying the transaction log since the most recent backup. This database recovery is possible with databases running on EC2. However, it can be challenging to manage. |

| **Sample Operational Readiness State Approach** |
| --- |
| Backup and Recovery With the deployment into AWS, XYZ will begin using the \[Customer\]'s current back up retention policy.  Life cycle policy to be applied to S3 buckets to move data to S3-IA and then Glacier.    EC2 instances to be backed up by taking EBS volumes backups. There are two automation frameworks available to implement in AWS:   1. [EBS Snapshot Scheduler](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/ebs-snapshot-scheduler/overview.html) – for single AWS Account 2. [AWS Ops Automator](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/infrastructure-management/ops-automator/) – for multiple AWS Accounts   EBS volumes will be backed on the following schedule:   1. Daily incremental backups will be maintained for 30 days. 2. Every 30 days, a monthly backup will be taken and retained for 12 months. 3. Annually, corresponding to the last month of the fiscal or calendar year, an annual back up will be taken and retained for three years. |

| **Recommendations for Future Enhancements** |
| --- |
| Backup and Recovery  A backup retention policy should be established including data stored in databases, EBS volumes, and S3. Well-Architected best practices for data backup include identifying all data that needs to be backed up and perform backups or reproduce the data from sources, and perform data backup automatically or reproduce the data from sources automatically using AWS features.  **S3**   * Identify any buckets or data that are considered extremely critical       + Enable MFA Delete on these buckets   + Consider enabling versioning on these buckets, but first review the cost and management implications (<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html>) * Configure lifecycle policies to transition infrequently used data to S3-IA or Glacier * Lifecycle policy recommendation:       + Days after object creation: 30 days – transition to S3-IA   + Days after object creation: 365 days – transition to Glacier   **EBS**  Base operating system EBS volumes should not require backups or snapshots. These should be restorable via a combination of the base AMI, user-data and any configuration management.  For volumes with persistent data that must be preserved, traditional backup rotation is not necessary with EBS. EBS snapshots contain the information needed to restore your data from the time the snapshot was taken to a new Amazon EBS volume.    We recommend only preserving the latest snapshot. It is strongly recommended to automate the creation and management of snapshots. AWS provides an [EBS Snapshot Scheduler tool](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/infrastructure-management/ebs-snapshot-scheduler/) to assist with EBS Snapshot management.  The preferred method of EBS snapshot scheduling is using AWS Backup.  When a specific workload or application has unique requirements that aren't satisfied by the AWS Backup plan, then you should schedule / create snapshots for that workload separately. |

Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery
==================================================

| **AWS Recommended Cloud Approach** |
| --- |
| **Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery** Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) are often two very different topics, with different but overlapping objectives and stakeholders. A BCP encompasses everything required for the business to continue to run, including staff relocation, customer communication, financial concerns and product/application availability. The BCP can help feed into the DR plan by setting RPO/RTO objectives and providing other key process requirements. BCP involves much more than the recovery of IT systems, and thus a comprehensive BCP should be documented and exercised outside the scope of this document, but this document should be included as part of that BCP.    **Disaster Recovery and AWS**  As discussed in section 4.4.1, AWS service offerings are available in multiple regions around the globe so that you can choose the most appropriate location for your production and DR site(s).  **Perform Periodic Recovery**  It is a Well-Architected best practice to validate that your backup process implementation meets Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective through a recovery test.  **Secure and Encrypt Backups**  Align to Well-Architected best practices by securing and encrypting backups, or ensuring the data is available from a secure source for reproduction. Detect access via authentication and authorization like AWS IAM, and detect integrity compromise by using encryption. |

| **Sample Operational Readiness State Approach** |

| **Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery** For the Operational Readiness State, \[Customer\] will follow the current BCP/DR process. The \[Customer\] Business Continuity for IT Data Centers is located here. |

| **Recommendations for Future Enhancements** |
| --- |
| **Business Continuity Planning and Disaster Recovery** **Establish RPO/RTO Objectives**  Determine and document both the recovery point and recovery time objectives for each application, aligning to Well-Architected best practices.    **Choose an alternate region or regions for a potential multi-region deployment.**  Whether you intend to run multi-region or not, it is best to identify at least potential regions based on service availability, latency, cost or other requirements. Review the AWS Region Table to select the best region(s). It's Well-Architected best practice to use defined disaster recovery strategies to meet your defined recovery objectives.    **Ensure S3 buckets with critical application data are configured for cross-region replication.**  It is not necessary to replicate utility buckets such as those that store operational data (logs). Buckets that contain data that is either not sensitive to latency or impactful to application runtime may also not require replication.    **Prepare for Pilot light deployment**   * Ensure all standard AMIs are copied to alternate region(s) * Integrate AMI copy process into patch management procedures, to ensure all future images are available in all regions * Configure database replica(s) in alternate region(s) * Consider DNS and routing requirements for cutting over to the alternate region if needed   **Determine long-term multi-region deployment strategy per application**   * Widespread AWS outages are rare, but they have happened. * Some applications may have different RPO/RTO and others may not require multi-region. * Assess, document and prepare for multi-region per application    Create an availability matrix by application and region if applicable. |

Design Patterns
===============

| **AWS Recommended Cloud Approach** |
| --- |
| **Patterns**  AWS published a "Well-Architected Framework" document that provides a consistent approach to designing application/infrastructure workloads. The key patterns of well-architected application/infrastructure workloads fall into six primary areas (pillars) of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.  Establishing patterns for enterprise workloads will be iterative and mature with cloud adoption. Enterprises should also account for Availability Management components such as the business criticality of applications to avoid over-engineering applications.  **Application Patterns**  In cloud platforms, an application pattern is a reusable design for common application architectures. Enterprises CCoE can create guidelines through patterns for application owners to use as workloads move to the cloud. These patterns will enable consistent delivery within cloud operating models used in the enterprise.  ***N-tier Patterns***  A multi-tier (n-tier) architecture is a client-server architecture in which, the presentation, services, and data management tiers are logically separate components. For example, an application that uses middleware to serve data requests between a user and a database utilizes an n-tier architecture. The most commonly used n-tier architecture refers to a three-tier architecture. The n-tier pattern is contained within an Amazon VPC and spans multiple availability zones to ensure high availability. A pattern to support an n-tier application pattern is described in the diagrams below.   worddav828d56f2b4b342b334ff319f80e0b56d.png    For dev/test n-tier applications, patterns are designed as a low-cost version of the production architecture. The general application structures remain the same, although instance counts and sizing are greatly reduced.    worddave2e2ee13bda9daff7ce4c0b5cabbba57.png |

| Operational Readiness State Approach |
| --- |
| **Design Patterns** As stated in the operating environments section, \[Customer\] Operational Readiness State initial applications workloads will follow the AMP1 Migration pattern (Lift and Shift) model to move to production (automated tools). Once the application workload is in production, any changes to the application occur in Development and will be promoted to Test and Production environments through application stacks. |

| **Recommendations for Future Enhancements** |
| --- |
| **Design Patterns**  * Establish Infrastructure Templates (infrastructure as code) * Create guidelines for templates within your CCoE * Establish a process for template lifecycle management via Service Catalog * Build templates with parameters to be populated from configuration management system * Continue with patterns to support MVP and future application workloads * Include Operational Metadata in template * Templates should be accessible via API's or console access to a centralized service catalog based upon role-based access (RBAC) |
