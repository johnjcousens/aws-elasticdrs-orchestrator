Patch Management Design
=======================

| **AWS Recommended Cloud Approach** |
| --- |
| **Patch Management** Some organizations take advantage of their existing investment in patch management tools and processes. Often when multiple tools and differing processes are used to address patch management, organizations coalesce around a single enterprise patch management solution. Leveraging patch management systems to remediate issues, gain desired features or capabilities, and to remain compliant aligns to Well-Architected Operational Excellence best practices.  Below are some of the common options used to address patch management:    Options:   * Some organizations when moving to the cloud will initially utilize their existing patch management process assuming their tool is cloud-aware and/or has the capability to perform the needed functions on the cloud * [AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html) can perform patch management functions across your environments and includes software inventory management, patch baselining, maintenance windows, and patch compliance reporting. * When using Auto Scaling with EC2, you will need to ensure that the underlying AMI used in by the launch configuration includes your patches.  You will need to update the AMIs used in your launch configurations with the latest patches and align their updates to your patch update cycle. * As organizations adopt services such as Amazon RDS and Amazon Elastic Beanstalk they take advantage of managed platform updates which handle the patch management for these services. * As organizations adopt fully managed services such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SQS, and AWS Lambda, patch management is handled entirely within the service. * Many customers utilize a number of patch management tools and use the migration to AWS to consolidate around a single solution such as [AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html)   .  **Automate Patching of long running Amazon EC2 instances using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager**  [Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html), a capability of AWS Systems Manager, automates the process of patching managed nodes with both security related and other types of updates. You can use Patch Manager to apply patches for both operating systems and applications. (On Windows Server, application support is limited to updates for applications released by Microsoft.) You can use Patch Manager to install Service Packs on Windows nodes and perform minor version upgrades on Linux nodes. You can patch fleets of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, or your on-premises servers and virtual machines (VMs) by operating system type. This includes supported versions of Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, CentOS, Debian Server, macOS, Oracle Linux, Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Ubuntu Server, and Windows Server. You can scan instances to see only a report of missing patches, or you can scan and automatically install all missing patches.  Customer will use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for patching Windows and Linux instances.  The following design decisions for AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager have been confirmed: Patching Schedule Customer will automatically apply patches for both Windows and Linux instances across all regions and accounts on the Sunday following Microsoft’s patch Tuesday, which currently falls on the second Tuesday of each month. Maintenance Window The patching schedule will be implemented as a AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Window.  Maintenance Windows are region and account specific.  In order to consistently manage the patching maintenance window, a CloudFormation template will be deployed as a service-managed StackSet to all accounts in the AWS Organization.  The following are the configuration details for the maintenance window:   * Maintenance Window Duration:  up to 4 hours * Cutoff Time (the amount of time new tasks are prevented from starting before the end of the maintenance window period.):    2 hours * Cron based schedule expressed as:  cron(0 30 23 ? \\* TUE#3 \\*) * Schedule Offset:  5 days  Patch Baseline The patch baseline defines what type of patches are applied, their compliance severity, exceptions, etc.  The [default, predefined patch baselines for AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-baselines.html#patch-manager-baselines-pre-defined) will be used.  Generally speaking, these automatically approve security related patches within 7 days of release.  See the documentation for details. **Patch Management integration with Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)** Amazon released updated AMIs for various operating systems that include the latest patches.  Customer is also creating their own AMI as described in the AMI management design.  The image pipelines for these AMIs will include a step that applies the appropriate patch baseline defined in this design.  The image pipelines will also be scheduled to run in the same maintenance window as the patching schedule to ensure they are producing AMIs aligned to the defined patching design. |

| **Recommendations for Future Enhancements** |
| --- |
| Post Operational Readiness State, Customer should create custom patch baselines that are fine tuned to customer requirements.  The custom patch baselines will define a level of compliance severity for improved reporting.  The custom patch baselines will also allow the customer to include patch exceptions so that patches that are not desired for installation are not applied.    Customer should explore the use of fully managed (e.g. Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, etc.) and/or serverless (AWS Lambda) cloud services for every project in an effort to reduce the future need for patching servers on every application.  Customer can further enhance their patching process by integrating security scans using [Amazon Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/what-is-inspector.html) into their process.  EC2 instances can be scanned for vulnerabilities and reports can be integrated along with the patch reporting.  Customer should perform patch scans prior to patch implementation.  The patch scans should provide notifications to each workload / Amazon EC2 instance owner about the patches that will be applied to their instances during the next patching cycle.  The workload instance owners information can be dynamically retrieved from the instances tags or from a CMDB.  Customer should integrate and improve automated testing of patches to verify that patched instances are still functioning properly.  The technical owners of each instance should be notified when patches have been applied to their instances.  Customer should provide compliance reporting on patch management across their accounts and regions.  The compliance severity levels defined for patch baselines should also include a remediation SLA and this should be communicated and available to AWS users for review.  Escalation notifications for non compliance should be implemented, integrated, and automated.  There may be remediation actions such as stopping of EC2 instances that don't meet the compliance SLA after a defined grace period.  Application patching standards should have a defined RACI for application level patching.  Customer should implement and align patch management standards for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) applications, open source, and custom developed applications deployed on EC2. |
