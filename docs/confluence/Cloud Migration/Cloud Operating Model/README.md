Mission Statement
=================

Plan, guide and support an efficient progression of the operational model during the migration. Provide best practices prescriptive guidance to enhance the operational model both when in hybrid mode as well as when all-in AWS.

Objectives
==========

Create roadmap for operational constructs to scale in AWS. Customers might prioritize different areas based on their IT Operations maturity level. Below is a list of common objectives.

* Identify desired ITSM state and support model
* Review current operational practices (tools, people, processes) on-premises and in the cloud
* Identify potential vulnerabilities around scaling operations
* Review BCP and create a plan to address any potential impact on operations
* Identify how the execution of the migration factory will impact normal operations
* Identify operational support organisms and partners that will interact with the cloud environments

Outcomes
========

* Improve operational posture and enhance SLA/OLAs
* Run-books and design guides for operational silos (backups, monitoring, deployments, etc..)
* Operational Playbook on AWS
* ITSM on AWS documented and defined (change, asset, incident, event, etc…)

Key Milestones
==============

Document current processes and models and determine future state for:

* Operational Capabilities / RACI
* Tag Management
* AMI Management
* Patch Management
* Event & Incident Management (includes Logging & Monitoring)
* Availability & Continuity Management (includes Backup / Restore)
* Change Management
* Configuration Management
* License Management
* Account & User Management

How to Use
==========

* This kit can be downloaded into a customer environment for the customer to own and keep
* Project is generally kicked off with workshops to understand customer's prioritization. Different customers might prioritize different areas/milestones based on maturity
* This kit comes with a separate list of user stories. For example, the customer can then pull various user stories into their projects as needed. They can also keep the stories to iterate after the migration project
* The are two types of artifacts aligned to an operational capability:
  1. Discovery and Analysis - use this to discover the customer capability and document the readiness state for that particular capability.
  2. Design - the design is where you get the best practices that you can use. The design section also has a sample readiness state that you can use to kick start your readiness state
* Best practices is to increase collaboration by having customer and consultants also contribute to the doc.

If guidelines are followed, natural flow of activities for each topic are as follows: gather current state through workshops, present AWS best practices while doing gap analysis  and describe  and document operational readiness state with designs.
