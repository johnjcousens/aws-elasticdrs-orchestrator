HIPAA Mapping: 45 CFR §164.310(d)(1) – Device and Media Controls

**Control Objective:**  
Ensure that the organization maintains a complete, accurate, and regularly updated inventory of all assets—including data, devices, and network-connected systems—so that they can be appropriately protected based on their classification, criticality, and location (including third-party or cloud-hosted assets).

**Technical & Operational Implementation:**

   * Network devices (routers, switches, firewalls)
   * Peripheral and storage equipment (printers, SANs)
   * Specialized systems (VoIP, virtual/ephemeral addresses, BYOD)
2. Assets storing or transmitting information—including sensitive data such as PII, whether encrypted or not—must also be recorded, regardless of whether they reside in the organization’s own network or at third-party-managed sites.

**Classification and Criticality Documentation**

3. The organization must document the criticality and business impact of each asset type or group, and label them accordingly (e.g., High, Moderate, Low criticality).

**Mobile, Portable, and BYOD Coverage**

4. Inventory processes must include all mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other portable data-handling devices—even if they are not connected to the corporate network.
5. Approved BYOD assets must be documented separately and tracked through formal onboarding and approval workflows.
