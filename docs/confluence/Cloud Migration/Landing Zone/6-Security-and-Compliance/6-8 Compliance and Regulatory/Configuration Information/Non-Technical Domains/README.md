**Purpose**  
This page serves as the centralized summary for all non-technical HITRUST CSF domains that fall outside the scope of the AWS migration project. It consolidates references to process, policy, and governance documentation for following domains:

* Information Protection Program
* Portable Media Security
* Mobile Device Security
* Wireless Security
* Education, Training and Awareness
* Third Party Assurance
* Risk Management
* Physical and Environmental Security to ensure complete visibility, traceability, and stakeholder involvement.

**Scope**  
This summary covers all HITRUST CSF domains that do not involve direct technical system configurations or cloud platform dependencies. These domains focus on organizational, administrative, and procedural controls that remain independent of AWS-managed environments, such as governance, workforce security, risk management, policy administration, and third-party oversight.

|  | **Non-Tech Domain** | **Requirement Summarization** | **Ownership** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Information Security Protection | 1. The HITRUST Information Security Protection domain focuses on establishing a **formal, documented, and management-approved information security management program (ISMP)** that aligns with industry frameworks and undergoes continuous improvement. 2. It emphasizes **clear assignment of security roles**, **pre-employment screening**, **user access agreements**, **acceptable use enforcement**, and **annual reviews** of policies and risk management. 3. It also requires **independent audits**, **document protection**, **change authorization**, and **training/awareness programs** to ensure security is embedded into organizational culture and operations. | HealthEdge must ensure:   * Draft, approve, and update ISMP and related security policies. * Perform personnel screening and role assignments. * Maintain access agreements and acceptable use enforcement. * Approve changes to operating procedures. * Manage annual independent security reviews. * Assign owners to information systems and ensure tagging/documentation. |
| 2 | Portable Media Security | 1. This domain ensures that all digital and non-digital media containing sensitive information are strictly **controlled, encrypted, and tracked** throughout their lifecycle. 2. Access to removable media is limited to authorized personnel with a valid business need, with technical controls such as USB device whitelisting, automated malware scanning, and encryption enforced. 3. Media handling includes secure transport using tamper-evident packaging, locked containers, or approved couriers, along with documented chain-of-custody records. 4. All media are **inventoried, labeled according to classification, and sanitized or destroyed per approved procedures** when no longer needed. | * Define and enforce portable media security policies, classification rules, and approval processes. * Approve, track, and restrict the use of removable media * Configure encryption, USB device whitelisting, and automated malware scanning on laptops and any systems that may connect to portable media. * Perform wiping, degaussing, or physical destruction of media per HITRUST/HIPAA requirements. * Implement secure transport methods, chain-of-custody logging, and courier selection for physical media. * Maintain and audit inventory records for all portable media, including movement, approvals, logging and disposition. |
| 3 | Mobile Device Security | 1. This domain focuses on securing mobile devices, mobile computing platforms, and teleworking environments to prevent unauthorized access, data loss, and system compromise. 2. Requirements include prohibiting circumvention of built-in device security controls, enforcing encryption, maintaining patch compliance, and controlling mobile device connections through centralized management solutions. 3. Teleworking arrangements require site security assessments, encrypted remote connections, controlled access to internal systems, and adherence to corporate security standards for wireless networks, firewalls, antivirus, and patching. 4. All mobile and remote access activities must be authorized, logged, and supported by enforceable agreements, with provisions for asset return, access revocation, and ongoing monitoring. | * Define mobile device usage, BYOD, encryption, teleworking, and acceptable use policies. * Implement and configure MDM tools to enforce encryption, patch compliance, remote wipe, and application restrictions. * Deploy personal firewalls, antivirus, and anti-malware scanning on all mobile/remote systems accessing sensitive data. * Restrict mobile/telework device access to approved networks, enforce VPN or encrypted tunnels, and configure WPA2/AES wireless security for home offices. * Limit access to only necessary systems/data; enforce MFA, strong passwords, and unique IDs for teleworkers. * Ensure mobile devices and teleworking systems have the latest OS and application patches. * Manage return, sanitization, and disposal of telework/mobile assets. |
| 4 | Wireless Security | 1. This domain ensures that all wireless network access is authorized, secured, and monitored to protect sensitive information. 2. Before deploying wireless access points, organizations must change all vendor default credentials, encryption keys, and other default security settings. Wireless traffic must be encrypted using a minimum of AES WPA2, with encryption keys rotation. 3. Quarterly scans must detect and remediate any unauthorized access points, while devices without a business need for wireless are required to have wireless capability disabled in hardware. | * Approve and document all wireless network usage, ensuring it aligns with HITRUST requirements. * Change vendor defaults (encryption keys, SNMP strings, passwords) before enabling wireless devices. * Ensure all wireless traffic uses at least AES WPA2 (or stronger) encryption for authentication and transmission. * Rotate wireless encryption keys when authorized personnel leave or change positions. * Perform quarterly scans for rogue/unauthorized access points and remediate as needed. |
| 5 | Education, Training and Awareness | 1. This domain ensures that all workforce members, including employees, contractors, executives, and technical staff, receive comprehensive security and privacy training tailored to their roles and responsibilities. 2. Training covers topics such as phishing awareness, secure coding, acceptable use, teleworking security, incident response, and handling of sensitive information. 3. Training effectiveness is reviewed annually, and records are retained for at least five years to maintain compliance evidence. 4. Organization enforces behavior expectations, sanctions for violations, and targeted reminders to reinforce secure practices in daily operations. | * Develop and implement the security and privacy awareness program, including onboarding and ongoing training. * Provide specialized training for developers, system admins, incident responders, and other personnel with elevated privileges. * Include phishingrecognition awareness training. Train on secure use of mobile devices, remote connections, and teleworking best practices. * Educate staff on rules for system usage, prohibited software installation, and data handling requirements. * Conduct yearly reviews of training effectiveness, update content based on risk assessments and maintain documented proof of training completion for at least five years. * Ensure sanctions or disciplinary actions are documented and communicated for security violations. |
| 6 | Third Party Assurance | 1. This domain governs how organizations grant, monitor, and manage access to their information systems and data by third parties, including vendors, contractors, customers, and outsourced service providers. 2. It mandates due diligence, contractual controls, risk assessments, and ongoing monitoring to ensure security and compliance obligations are met across the supply chain. 3. Detailed agreements must define responsibilities, liabilities, incident reporting procedures, service levels, legal compliance, and intellectual property protections. 4. Continuous oversight—including periodic audits, SLA reviews, change management, and incident handling—ensures third-party access remains secure, compliant, and aligned with organizational requirements. | * Perform due diligence on all third parties with logical or physical access to systems or data, including security assessments, certifications (e.g., HITRUST), and NDAs. * Draft, negotiate, and enforce contracts that define security obligations, incident notification requirements, service levels, data protection responsibilities, and termination clauses. * Limit third-party access to the minimum required and VPN, encryption, and secure protocols for all remote access to covered information. * Review SLA performance, monitor security controls, conduct annual reviews, and ensure third-party compliance via audits. * Ensure third parties follow agreed-upon incident reporting timelines (e.g., ≤60 days) and participate in coordinated response efforts. * Supervise outsourced software development, mandate security reviews, code audits, and secure coding practices. |
| 7 | Risk Management | 1. HITRUST requires a formal, continuously-improving risk management program that sets risk tolerance, performs risk assessments on a defined schedule and at major change points, and feeds results into change approvals and security planning. 2. HealthEdge should produce approved risk treatment plans mapped to HITRUST controls, track remediation through corrective-action plans, and ensure classification, architecture, SDLC, acquisition, and outsourcing all embed security requirements. 3. Governance includes annual audit planning, management authorization for production use, and documented security/architecture updates aligned to enterprise strategy | HealthEdge owns this program end-to-end—policies, assessments, tolerance, treatment plans, change/risk integration, classification, SDLC gates, supplier/contract security, audit planning, and authorizations. |
| 8 | Physical and Environmental Security | 1. HITRUST requires that all facilities, systems, and equipment handling sensitive data be physically secured with controlled access, monitored entry, and documented visitor management. 2. Environmental safeguards such as fire suppression, water leak detection, UPS power backup, and hazard assessments must be in place and regularly tested. 3. Equipment maintenance must follow a documented, authorized, and logged process, with post-maintenance verification of security controls and strict oversight for nonlocal diagnostics. 4. Media disposal procedures must ensure permanent destruction or sanitization using approved methods, including third-party disposal oversight. | * HealthEdge must implement and manage facility security, access control lists, visitor management, environmental monitoring devices, physical audit logs, maintenance authorization, and all media disposal activities for customer-managed facilities and equipment. * Customer is responsible for enforcing policies, performing testing, and retaining documentation for audits. |
