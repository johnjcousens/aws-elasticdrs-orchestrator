At AWS, security is our top priority and security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between AWS and our customer. Financial services providers, healthcare providers, and governmental agencies are among the customers, who trust us with some of their most sensitive information. You can improve your ability to meet core security, confidentiality, and compliance requirements with our comprehensive services, whether that's through Amazon GuardDuty or our AWS Nitro System, the underlying platform for our EC2 instances. We've designed the Nitro System to have workload confidentiality and no operator access. With the Nitro System, there's no mechanism for any system or person to log in to EC2 servers, read the memory of EC2 instances, or access any data stored on instance storage and encrypted EBS volumes. In addition, services such as AWS CloudHSM and AWS Key Management Service allow you to securely generate and manage encryption keys, and AWS Config and AWS CloudTrail deliver monitoring and logging capabilities for compliance and audits.

Using AWS, you will gain the control and confidence you need to securely run your business with the most flexible and secure cloud computing environment available today. As an AWS customer, you will benefit from AWS data centers and a network architected to protect your information, identities, applications, and devices. With AWS, you can improve your ability to meet core security and compliance requirements, such as data locality, protection, and confidentiality with our comprehensive services and features.

AWS allows you to automate manual security tasks so you can shift your focus to scaling and innovating your business. Plus, you pay only for the services that you use. All customers benefit from AWS being the only commercial cloud that has had its service offerings and associated supply chain vetted and accepted as secure enough for top-secret workloads.
