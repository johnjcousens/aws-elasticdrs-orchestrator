<strong><u>What is the Decision Dashboard?</u></strong> 
                
<span>The Decision Dashboard within Cutover serves as a centralized
                        place to track the customer’s decisions throughout their cloud journey. This mechanism helps
                        facilitate the decision workflow and serves as a historical record. All stakeholders involved in
                        the project have access to this catalog to be able to view final decisions and propose
                        recommendations and/or request decisions. This mechanism helps customers manage two-way door
                        decisions and overcome blockers by requiring data and documentation to support decisions.</span>
