title: Runbook - How to Run a Migration Wave
--------------------------------------------

Section 1 - Running a dry run of the application runbook
========================================================

Related task IDs: WAV-E01-005  
Role responsible: Migration Lead

For each application that is due to be migrated a dry-run or walk through of the application runbook tasks should be performed with SME familiar with the application's support and development, this enables the migration teams to capture any specific tasks that need to be factored into the migration and also ensure that all teams members understand the end to end process that will be occurring before, during and after the migration of their application to AWS. Dry-runs should ideally have representatives from each team that have assigned tasks in the runbook.

1. Open the application specific runbook from the Runbooks view in Cutover.
2. At this point you should either click start on the runbook and then run a rehearsal, or walk through the tasks in the List view of Cutover.
3. Update runbook with any app specific tasks or remove tasks that are not required.
4. Get sign-off for the application runbook.
