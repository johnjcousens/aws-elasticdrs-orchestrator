AWS Rapid Migration is comprised of two buckets of work: 
1) <strong>the foundation work</strong> which includes, but is not limited to, Governance
                        workstream, Portfolio workstream, Platform workstream, and Migration set-up
2) <strong>the migration work</strong> which includes application and wave migration activities. 
                    
<br/>
<strong><u>To report on the foundation
                                work</u></strong> 
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the Rapid Migration runbook. </li>
<li>Once in that runbook, click Dashboards and select the "Rapid Migration" Dashboard. 
                        </li>
<li>Inspect the Dashboard:<ol>
<li>Ensure the Dashboard has no filters applied.</li>
<li>Identify and tasks that are blocked and/or late. </li>
<li>Double-check that the dashboard is showing your team's latest progress before you
                                    proceed. The dashboard reflects real-time progress, so be mindful of when you export
                                    PDF reports or snapshots as the status may change. (also keep in mind the timezones
                                    your team is working as you may want/need to pull the report to align accordingly) 
                                </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Once you're satisfied with the report content, you can export to a PDF as a way of "taking a
                            snapshot" of the project at a certain point in time. 
                        </li>
<li>The PDF export can be used to report to the customer on a weekly basis. Remember to save the
                            status report in a folder where the customer can access and link the report to the Status
                            Reports page of the delivery kit. </li>
</ol>
<br/>
<strong><u>To report on the migration work</u></strong> 
<ol>
<li><span>The multi-runbook dashboard is the best place to pull a
                                status report against migration progress.</span></li>
<li><span>Navigate to the Multi Runbook Dashboard by going to the
                                Workspace, then clicking Dashboards, and select the "Multi Runbook Dashboard"</span> 
                                <img src="../../attachments/MultiRunbookDashNav.png"/>
</li>
<li><span>The Multi Runbook Dashboard contains interactive visuals
                                that communicate progress.</span> <ol>
<li>You can download a PDF of this report to serve as a snapshot of migration process. 
                                </li>
<li>First - Double-check that the dashboard is showing your team's latest progress
                                    before you proceed. The dashboard reflects real-time progress, so be mindful of when
                                    you export PDF reports or snapshots as the status may change. (also keep in mind the
                                    timezones your team is working as you may want/need to pull the report to align
                                    accordingly) </li>
