title: Cutover Notifications for Automaiton
-------------------------------------------

Introduction
============

Cutover's native functionality today supports notifications when changes or updates are made within a runbook. Notifications can be helpful when wanting to understand the current state of a task, notifying the owner(s) when a new task comes up, or if a runbook is paused or canceled. Communications can be shared via email or SMS.

Section 1 - Rehersal or Live Run Notifications
==============================================

In order to notify participants that a runbook has launched, ensure that communications have been enabled.

When starting a runbook, users can identify the 'Run Type' to be a rehersal mode, or ready to launch the runbook. When prompted in the same box, a user can change the Communication Settings to 'on'. Lastly, users can check if they would like to notify participants on a runbook start.

Section 2 - Task Start
======================

There will be cases where users will want to be notified when a previous task is completed, and the next task is ready to start. These notifications can be enabled for email, or SMS for those who prefer texts.

Section 3 - Paused & Canceled Runbooks
======================================

Users can also be notified in the case of a runbook pause or canceled runbook.

In either case, upon requesting to pause or cancel a runbook, a box will show where users can deterime if they would like to pause or cancel a run along with a check box to indicate the notification to participants. An optional message can be shared alongside the notification.

Section 4 - Resumed Runbook
===========================

If a runbook is paused, users can also notify team members when a runbook has resumed. This can optionally call out both the runbook resume and the ability to start new, upcoming tasks.
