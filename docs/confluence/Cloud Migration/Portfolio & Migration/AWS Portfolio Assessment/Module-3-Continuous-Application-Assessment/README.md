title: Module 3 - Continuous Application Assessment
---------------------------------------------------

Overview
========

At this stage of Portfolio Assessment it is assumed that the activities under

Module 1-Discovery Acceleration and Initial Planning
, and

Module 2-Portfolio Analysis and Migration Planning
 have been completed. Typically, all Mobilize activities to establish platform, security, and operational foundations would have been completed as well. The Continuous Application Assessment stage focuses on detailed application assessment on a wave by wave basis. The goal is to perform the detailed assessment needed to achieve migration readiness for a given set of applications on a given migration wave. The wave assessment activities can be repeated sequentially until program completion.

Primary Outcomes
----------------

1. AWS Application Architecture Design for Wave n
2. Validated Migration Strategy for Wave n
3. Iterated/Validated Wave Plan and Dependency Groups (if required)

Pre-Requisites
--------------

* Platform, Operations, Security, and Migration Factory foundations in place, validated, and tested.
* Portfolio Level data available, including Application and Infrastructure inventory.
* Baselined Migration Wave Plan (from Mobilize phase)

Activity Details
----------------

| **Activity** | **Details / Guidance** | **Artifacts** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wave Application Assessment | When migrating/modernizing at scale, it is important to assess applications closer to the migration date whilst still allowing for enough time to adjust cutover plans and AWS requirements. The main goal of this activity is to focus on the applications that are part of a given wave, and perform detailed assessment to create/validate the target AWS Design and Migration Strategy for each application on a given wave.  **Note:** depending on the strategy chosen for the applications in the wave, there could be significant variation in the level of detail required. For example, most Rehost strategies will require a simple design and less discovery details, the focus will be mainly in validating technology stack compatibility, operations, and security. On the other hand, a Refactor approach will require detailed designs and understanding of the application. Consider adapting the scope of the detailed assessment, questionnaires and design templates to meet the level of complexity required. Consider also reusing architectural templates/designs that could apply to more than one application of similar characteristics. | Detailed Application Assessment (Pilot apps or waves) |
