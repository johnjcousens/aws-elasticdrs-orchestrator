**Document Objective**
======================

This technical blueprint details the architectural design and specifications for implementing HealthEdge Guiding Care within the AWS cloud environment. The document is for technical professionals who possess working experience with AWS services and their associated terminology.

Background
==========

This document outlines the “GC Architecture Design for AWS Cloud” and is subject to client review, modifications, and approvals prior to implementation. Upon reviewing this document, readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of GC business units target architecture for its AWS environment, as well as the key elements that need to be addressed to successfully implement this strategy. It is important to note that this strategy is expected to be dynamic and evolve over time as additional perspectives and considerations come to light.

Target State
============

Below diagram shows the target state for Guiding Care (GC) in AWS. Each key component is described in detail in the architectural components table section below.
