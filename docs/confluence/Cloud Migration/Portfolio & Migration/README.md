Portfolio & Migration in AWS Cloud Migration project involves analyzing and categorizing existing applications and data to plan their move to AWS. This includes assessment of current IT assets using the 6R strategy (Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Retire, Retain, or Repurchase), creating a detailed migration roadmap, and prioritizing workloads based on business value and technical complexity. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition while minimizing risks and maintaining business continuity throughout the migration process.
