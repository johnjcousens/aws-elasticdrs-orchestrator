Wave Names Fix Summary - CamelCase Migration
==============================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Wave names showing as blank in frontend
- Root cause: Field name mismatch between frontend and API

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Frontend Wave interface restored to original v1.3.0 format:
   - name: string (not waveName)
   - description?: string (not waveDescription)

✅ API Lambda code updated to support BOTH field name formats:
   - Accepts both 'name' and 'waveName' from frontend
   - Returns both 'waveName' and 'waveDescription' in responses
   - Backward compatibility maintained

✅ Frontend components updated:
   - RecoveryPlanDialog.tsx: Maps frontend fields to API fields correctly
   - WaveConfigEditor.tsx: Uses original field names (name, description)
   - Types interface: Restored to v1.3.0 format

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✅ API Testing:
   - Recovery plans API returns correct wave data
   - Wave names visible: "DatabaseTier", "ApplicationTier", "DatabaseWave"
   - Both waveName and waveDescription fields present in API responses

✅ Frontend Deployment:
   - Built successfully with TypeScript validation
   - Deployed to CloudFront: https://***REMOVED***.cloudfront.net
   - CloudFront cache invalidated

✅ Database Consistency:
   - All recovery plans have correct wave names in database
   - No PascalCase fields remaining
   - Native camelCase schema working

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Wave names fix COMPLETE
✅ Frontend deployed with corrected field mappings
✅ API supports both field name formats for compatibility
✅ All recovery plan wave names should now display correctly in frontend

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test frontend UI to verify wave names display correctly
2. Test recovery plan creation/editing with wave names
3. Verify end-to-end functionality: frontend → API → database → response

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Frontend uses: name, description (original v1.3.0 format)
- API accepts: name OR waveName, description OR waveDescription
- API returns: waveName, waveDescription (for consistency)
- Database stores: waveName, waveDescription (camelCase format)

This maintains backward compatibility while ensuring consistent camelCase
throughout the database and API layers.
