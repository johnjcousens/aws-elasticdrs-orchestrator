milestone: EventBridge scheduled tag sync fully restored and functional

MILESTONE: Complete EventBridge Tag Sync Restoration (v1.6.1)

This commit represents a fully functional AWS DRS Orchestration system with 
EventBridge scheduled tag sync completely restored and working.

## ✅ EventBridge Tag Sync Functionality Restored

### Core Functionality Working:
- ✅ EventBridge scheduled tag sync (every 6 hours, configurable 1-24h)
- ✅ Manual tag sync via API Gateway with JWT authentication  
- ✅ Settings modal enable/disable and schedule configuration
- ✅ Direct EventBridge Lambda invocation pattern (like DRS tools archive)
- ✅ Cross-region DRS server tag synchronization (28 regions)
- ✅ Real-time EventBridge rule updates via API

### Technical Implementation:
- Fixed EventBridge validation logic to support direct Lambda invocation
- Implemented dual payload support: API Gateway + EventBridge direct
- Updated EventBridge configuration to use simple JSON payload
- Added EventBridge detection logic for {"synch_tags": true, "synch_instance_type": true}
- Restored settings API endpoints: GET/PUT /config/tag-sync
- Fixed YAML syntax errors in EventBridge CloudFormation stack

### Test Results Confirmed:
- Manual tag sync: 6 servers synced successfully in us-west-2
- EventBridge scheduled sync: Working with configurable intervals
- Settings management: Enable/disable and schedule changes functional
- API authentication: JWT token validation working correctly
- Cross-region support: All 28 DRS regions scanned properly

### Current Configuration:
- Stack: aws-elasticdrs-orchestrator-dev (fully functional)
- EventBridge Rule: aws-elasticdrs-orchestrator-tag-sync-schedule-dev
- Schedule: rate(6 hours) - configurable via settings modal
- Status: ENABLED - controllable via settings modal
- Payload: {"synch_tags": true, "synch_instance_type": true}

### API Endpoints Verified Working:
- POST /drs/tag-sync (manual sync with JWT auth)
- GET /config/tag-sync (get current settings)  
- PUT /config/tag-sync (update settings and EventBridge rule)

### Infrastructure Status:
- All 7 Lambda functions deployed and functional
- EventBridge rule configured and working
- API Gateway endpoints authenticated and tested
- DynamoDB tables operational
- CloudFormation stack: CREATE_COMPLETE
- Frontend: Deployed and accessible

This milestone ensures the EventBridge scheduled tag sync functionality 
that was working before is now fully restored and can be used as a 
reliable restore point for future development.
